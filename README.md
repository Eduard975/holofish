# Script for auto-fishing/idling in HoloCure - Save the Fans!
This script allows you to auto-fish in [HoloCure - Save the Fans!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420510/HoloCure__Save_the_Fans/) up to a streak of 50. /
  It periodically takes a image of you screen then looks for specific colors in that image then if it finds one of the right colors it will press it's corresponding input. /
  For the inputs i used a slightly modifed version of [directKeys.py](https://gist.github.com/runew0lf/6e1004daffbd0547b76a8661cea75083).
